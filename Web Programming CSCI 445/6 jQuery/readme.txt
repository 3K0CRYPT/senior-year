Navbar CSS3 used, and function:
border-radius: This defines the radius of size specified to make circular corners on the nav buttons.
box-shadow: defines the size of a shadow, its blur & spread, and its colors, and gives it to the parent element (as all elements are boxes)
:hover selector: defines how to style an element when hovered over by the cursor

Personal CSS3:
I added two more CSS3 features to *the navbar* which are:

transform: transforming the element (in this case, rotating it)
transition: creations animated/fading effects whenever the style of an element is modified by an event or selector style change.

jQuery extra credit:

My questions are dynamically populated based on the JSON object specified at the top of the quiz.js file! This means you can simply specify any number of questions (with answer, description, and actual question) into the JSON object and the webpage will automatically create the buttons and check for the appropriate answer dynamically.
